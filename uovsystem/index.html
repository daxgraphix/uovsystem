                The University Online Voting System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the democratic process of electing student leaders within the university. 
                This system allows registered students to cast their votes securely, review candidatesâ€™ profiles, and view real-time results of the elections. 
                The system is designed to ensure accessibility, security, and transparency throughout the voting process.
