PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The University Online Voting System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the democratic process of electing student leaders within the university. 
This system allows registered students to cast their votes securely, review candidates’ profiles, and view real-time results of the elections. 
The system is designed to ensure accessibility, security, and transparency throughout the voting process. It will be easy to navigate,
with a streamlined interface that allows users to register, vote, and track election progress from any location on campus or at home.
This system will help eliminate the logistical challenges of traditional voting methods, such as long queues, the potential for fraud, 
and the lack of transparency. With this solution, student elections will be more efficient, transparent, and inclusive, offering students a seamless voting experience. 
Furthermore, it will also provide valuable insights through data analytics for future election improvements.

REASONS FOR CHOOSING THE PROJECT:

•	Solving a Local Problem: Traditional voting methods, especially on university campuses, often involve long waiting times, 
logistical challenges, and human errors. The online voting system will solve these issues by providing a fast, secure, 
and accurate way for students to vote for their leaders. It also enables the university to reach more students, 
including those who cannot be physically present at voting booths.

•	Passion: Our team is passionate about utilizing technology to solve real-world problems. 
We believe that student government elections are a critical part of student life, 
and we are excited to provide an innovative solution that enhances participation and transparency.

•	Innovation/Creativity: This project combines cutting-edge web technologies, including security protocols such as two-factor authentication and data encryption, 
to provide a reliable and trustworthy voting platform. Real-time results and transparent election processes make this solution stand out from conventional election systems.

WEBSITE FUNCTIONS:

•	Secure User Authentication: Users will register with their email and validate their account with a one-time password or email link.
•	Voting Mechanism: A secure, one-vote-per-user system to ensure integrity and fairness.
•	Real-Time Results: Instant updates on the results page once the voting period is over.
•	Admin Panel: For election organizers to configure elections, manage users, candidates, and election results.
•	Candidate Profile Pages: Each candidate will have a page with their biography, platform, and personal statement.

•	Design Flexibility: The visual representations and design concepts are not final; adjustments may be made based on ongoing testing, feedback, or project requirements. 
The visuals provided here are illustrative and meant to show possible end appearances. Final designs will be refined for optimal functionality and usability.

While we have carefully planned the timeline for the development of the University Online Voting System for Student Government Elections, it is important to recognize that project schedules are subject to change due to a variety of factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to:

1.	Team Availability:
The availability and involvement of team members can impact the pace of work. Given that all members have academic and personal commitments,
delays or shifts in team participation may affect the timely completion of tasks.

2.	Technical Challenges:
As we progress through the development stages, unforeseen technical challenges may arise, particularly when integrating different components of the system
(e.g., backend PHP functionalities, front-end design, or user interface elements). These challenges may require additional time for troubleshooting and debugging.

3.	Feedback and Testing:
Our project is dependent on iterative feedback and testing. The quality assurance phase, in particular, may take longer than expected,
as thorough testing is essential to ensure the system functions correctly and is secure for use. Feedback from peers or instructors may also necessitate adjustments to the system,
potentially altering the project timeline.

4.	Resource Constraints:
Availability of resources (such as development tools, access to testing environments, or collaborative platforms)
 may cause delays in meeting specific deadlines. This could include issues with software access or team members needing additional time to learn specific technologies.

5.	External Factors:
Unforeseen external factors, such as personal emergencies, public holidays, or disruptions in the academic schedule, may also impact the planned timeline.
These factors are beyond our control but will be addressed with adjustments to the schedule as needed.
